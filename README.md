# Getir Assignment

Actually, it was supposed to have only one end-point, but since I could not see the data in the sent database, I also wrote an end-point to create my own database and enter new records.

- URI of this database: mongodb+srv://user:Tx0JtReiNt8RaMqv@cluster0.4qjru.mongodb.net/Cluster0?retryWrites=true&w=majority

- Actually requested end-poit URL: https://getir-minel.herokuapp.com
- The URL I used to create new data: https://getir-minel.herokuapp.com/new

- I wrote the tests on Postman. Postman collection link: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0727f9f79e546a51145f
